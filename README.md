# Extendable deployment of 5G core network in cloud environment
The engineering thesis for ICT faculty at AGH for the years 2019-2023.
## Description:
The purpose of this thesis is to explore the possibilities in terms of virtualization of core network infrastructure for fifth-generation mobile networks. The thesis describes attempts to demonstrate the operation of 5G core functions as stand-alone applications, embedded in a cloud environment. The study verified the possibility of extending the set of core network functions with modules defined by 3GPP standards. A sample module has been successfully implemented.
